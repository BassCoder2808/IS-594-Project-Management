## Week 2: Requirement Finalization and Dataset Collection
### What was done:

Finalized feature requirements for distress detection, route prediction, and cyberbullying detection.
Identified public datasets for audio distress signals and cyberbullying text analysis.
Reviewed federated learning tools like TensorFlow Federated.
### Challenges faced:

Finding datasets with sufficient diversity and quality for machine learning training.
Understanding integration requirements for federated learning.
### What needs to be done next week:

Start preprocessing the identified datasets for training models.
Design the high-level architecture for distress detection.
