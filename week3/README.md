## Week 3: Dataset Preprocessing and Initial Architecture Design
### What was done:

Cleaned and annotated distress audio datasets to remove noise and improve quality.
Explored Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools for cyberbullying detection.
Drafted the architecture design for the distress detection module.
### Challenges faced:

Managing noisy and incomplete data in audio datasets.
Balancing data preprocessing efforts with architectural design tasks.
### What needs to be done next week:

Develop the first prototype of the distress detection model.
Research APIs for real-time geospatial data for route prediction.
