## Week 5: Cyberbullying Detection Module Design
### What was done:

Designed the architecture for the cyberbullying detection module using NLP techniques.
Integrated additional datasets for diverse cyberbullying scenarios (text and image-based).
Explored legal frameworks for mapping detected incidents to relevant IPC sections.
### Challenges faced:

Ensuring the model supports multiple languages and context-sensitive text processing.
Linking detection outputs to accurate IPC sections.
### What needs to be done next week:

Develop and test the cyberbullying detection model prototype.
Begin integrating federated learning workflows into the distress detection model.
