## Week 7: Safest Route Prediction Algorithm Development
### What was done:

Designed the algorithm for safest route prediction, prioritizing safety metrics over shortest distance.
Integrated real-time data sources such as crime statistics and traffic conditions using available APIs.
Conducted initial tests to validate the effectiveness of the route suggestions.
### Challenges faced:

Limited access to real-time crime data due to API restrictions.
Ensuring the algorithm runs efficiently on mobile devices with limited resources.
### What needs to be done next week:

Optimize the route prediction algorithm for performance and accuracy.
Explore alternative data sources or partnerships for comprehensive safety data.
Start integrating all modules into a unified application.
