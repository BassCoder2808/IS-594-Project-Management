## Week 6: Development of Cyberbullying Detection Prototype
### What was done:

Developed the initial version of the cyberbullying detection model using NLP techniques.
Trained the model on preprocessed datasets and tested it on sample text data.
Began integrating federated learning into the distress detection module for privacy preservation.
### Challenges faced:

Handling context and sarcasm in text, which affected the accuracy of the cyberbullying detection model.
Complexity in implementing federated learning without compromising model performance.
### What needs to be done next week:

Fine-tune the cyberbullying detection model to improve accuracy.
Set up a simulation environment to test federated learning across devices.
Begin designing the safest route prediction algorithm.
