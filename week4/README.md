## Week 4: Development of Distress Detection Prototype
### What was done:

Implemented the first version of the distress detection model using pre-trained audio classification networks.
Conducted initial testing on small datasets to validate model accuracy.
Reviewed geospatial APIs for real-time route prediction, including Google Maps and OpenStreetMap.

### Challenges faced:

Low accuracy in the initial distress detection model due to limited data diversity.
Understanding licensing constraints for geospatial API usage.

### What needs to be done next week:

Fine-tune the distress detection model and expand training datasets.
Start designing the cyberbullying detection module.
